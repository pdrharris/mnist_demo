# MNIST Demo
This demo aims to give a full walkthrough of how to create predictions on the MNIST dataset.

The key difference between this and other demos is that the data is stored as png files, with a csv file that matches the images to their relevant labels.

The pdf file "Demo Guide.pdf" gives more information about which files to run.

If you just want to the demo without downloading the dataset or installing python, the link below should enable you to do that.
